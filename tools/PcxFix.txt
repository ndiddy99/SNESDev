A PCX can have greater color depth than is actually possible on the SNES.

If you're tired of transfering stuff back and forth to see what looks good, try this.
This program will modify the palette in a PCX so that you can see what it would
look like on the SNES before transferring it over.

I know, not exetremely useful...
