note that this project's on hiatus until I make a real game in a language besides ASM due to me not
wanting to figure out stuff like object spawning, etc. for the first time in ASM.

figured i'd make this because apparently like 6 people starred this project despite me not linking
to it anywhere. anyway, if the game doesn't work on real hardware or something it's because i test
it on hardware far less often than i probably should. also, don't make up your opinion on the thing
until i actually put a release up, the .smc file is just there so i don't have to rebuild on the
shitty old computer i have connected to my game doctor.
